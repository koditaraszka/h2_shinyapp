The phenotype of interest, $Y$, is a quantitative trait for $N$ unrelated individuals. This can be thought of as the continuous unobserved liability in the liability threshold model.

We will assume everyone developed the disease dependendent on the liability and that their age of onset follows a truncated Gaussian distribution with truncation occurring at $\Phi^{-1}(0.025)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)$ quantiles. The intent of these simulations is to explore heritability of the continuous liability. The age-of-onset is to make the method compatible with the cox frailty model.
