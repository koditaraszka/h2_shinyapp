Let $Y$ be a continuous phenotype measured for $N$ unrelated individuals. This phenotype can be thought of as the continuous liability of developing a disease with carrier status occurring when the liability exceeds a threshold $T$, $Y \ge T$. The liability follows the standard normal distribution and is composed of two independent components, $Y = l_g + l_e$.

The genetic component, $l_g$, follows the Gaussian distribution:

\begin{align}
  l_g \sim N(0, h^2)
\end{align}

while the environmental component $l_e$ follows the Gaussian:

\begin{align}
  l_e \sim N(0, 1-h^2)
\end{align}

In both distributions, $h^2$ represents the additive heritability. 

For simplicity, we assume everyone develops the disease and therefore exceeds the liability treshold. We further assume that only the liability of developing the disease is heritable. For individuals who develop the disease, the age-of-onset follows the truncated Gaussian with the minimum and maximum age representing $\Phi^{-1}(0.025)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)$, respectively. 

We relax the assumption that the age-of-onset is not a function of the liability (l) and assume that the age-of-onset is drawn from the logistic function:

\begin{align}
-ln(\frac{1}{(1-\Phi(l))} - 1)
\end{align}

The distribution is then shifted and scaled such that the age-of-onset fall within the minimum and maximum age.

We note that instead of directly generating the genetic liability $l_g$ from the normal distribution (shown above), we observe the standardized genotype matrix $X$ containing $M$ SNPs. We assume there are $C \subseteq M$ causal SNPs whose effect sizes, $\beta$ are drown according to the polygenic model:

\begin{align}
\beta \sim N(0, \frac{h^2}{M})
\end{align}
